# Analyzing-US-Crime-Data
*Project of the Statistical Inference and Data Analysis Course Offered in Fall 2022 @ Zewail City*

In this project we used the publicly available crime data offered by the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and information/ucr/publications) (FBI) and the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://bjs.ojp.gov/data-collection/ncvs) (BJS) to analyze the patterns of crime in the U.S across time, regions, and demographics.

## Project Parts:

The project is divided into 6 Parts:

### 1) Data Collection and Cleaning: 
In this part, we collected 4 datasets to be used in the project. Thereadter, we cleaned them as to make them having descriptive column/variable names and numerically-encoded categories replaced by their descriptive string in the analysis outputs and plots.

   * The national crime victimization survey [(NCVS)](https://bjs.ojp.gov/national-crime-victimization-survey-ncvs-api#zjwnq9)
   * [NIBRS](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/docApi) Reported offense count data.
   * [Recidivism data for the state of Georgia [2013-2015]](https://data.ojp.usdoj.gov/Courts/NIJ-s-Recidivism-Challenge-Full-Dataset/ynf5-u8nk)
   * [Firearm laws per state](https://www.statefirearmlaws.org/resources)

### 2) Exploratory Analysis: 
In this part, we used the appropriate statistics and plots to investigate the following:

   1. National criminal offense rates per year across all available years for the top five most frequent offense categories.
   2. The average percentage of violent crimes relative to total crime per state over all available years.
   3. National homicide rates, as well as total violent crime rates per year over all years.
   4. The frequency of non-fatal crime incidents in relation to victim demographics.
   5. The frequency of non-fatal crime incidents in relation to offender demographics.
   6. The relationship between the victimâ€™s education level, their gross household income, and their rate of victimization.

### 3) Answering Questions: 
In this part, we used the appropriate statistics and plots to investigate the following:
